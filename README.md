Replace your traditional hand-written bag tag with an hybrid QRCode/NFC one. If someone finds your lost bag, all he have to do is to scan your tag with his smartphone (and geolocation activated): this will bring him to your dedicated ID page and send you a report email with the current position of your bag.
