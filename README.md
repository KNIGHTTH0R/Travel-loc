Travel-loc
==========

Replace your traditional hand-written bag tag with an hybrid QRCode/NFC one. If someone finds your lost bag, all he have to do is to scan your tag with his smartphone (and geolocation activated): this will bring him to your dedicated ID page and send you a report email with the current position of your bag. (based on a concept by nrauber)

Once you will have installed and configured all these files on your server, you will be able to create QRCodes and NFC Tags containing URL with information on techno used to scan (mod), and UID (uniq ID) as variables.
Example: http://www.my-domain.com/travel-loc/?uid=UID0001&mod=QRC
Then you'd better use URL shortener on this kind of complex and long URL (depending on NFC and QRCode datas capacity).
